# 1. What are the major greenhouse gases of rice ecosystems? Shortly discuss relevant factors for their production/consumption.

CO2:
Production:
When CH4 is oxidized in the upper soil layers, CO2 is beeing produced.
Consumption:
Photosynthesis

N2O:
Production:
Fertilization

CH4:
Production:
In lower layers under anaerobic conditions, when there is no more oxygen as an
electron acceptor CO2 is used instead and mehtane is produced.
Comsumption:
Oxidization of CH4 to CO2 in upper layers.


# 2. What are the major transport pathways of gaseous substances in and out of the soil system?
Diffusion through plant aerenchyma, ebullition and dissusion through soil layers.
