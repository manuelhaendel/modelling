# Questions
## 1. What are the main components of an ecosystem N budget?



## 2. What are the major N cycling processes in soils? Brieﬂy describe the N cycle in ecosystems.

N2 -> NH4:
biological/industrial N2 fixation
NH4 -> NO3:
nitrification
NH4 <-> micr. biom.:
immobilisation
ammonification
NH4 -> NH3:
volatilization
NH4 -> Plant:
uptake
NO3 -> Plant:
uptake
NO3 leaching
NO3 -> N2:
denitrification
micr. biom <-> SOM:
depolymerisation
senescence
Plant -> SOM:
senescence
